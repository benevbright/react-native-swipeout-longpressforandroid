I added Long press Android behavior with using awesome [Action Sheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-actionsheet) libarary on awesome [Swipeout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-swipeout) library.
Because "Swipe to delete" action is not compatible for Android since it has horizontal scrollable tab navigation.

Now it works like this.
